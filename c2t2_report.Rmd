**Costumer preferences: Acer or Sony**
---

We have a 14,898-line dataset about consumer characteristics. One of the attributes of the set was whether the customer prefers **Acer** or **Sony** brand. The dataset, however, had 5,000 missing values about the brand customers prefer. The purpose of this project was to predict these 5,000 pieces of information. The result was as follows:

38.3% (1,915) prefer **Acer**

61,7% (3,085) prefer **Sony**

When we gather all the information (9,898 lines of existing information plus the 5,000 lines predicted), we get the following result: 

38% (5,659) prefer **Acer**

62% (9,239) prefer **Sony**



**Background**
---

The dataset consists of 7 attributes. Two of them were chosen: **age** and **salary**. After testing all the features, these two best built a model that could find patterns and summarize the reality of consumers.
